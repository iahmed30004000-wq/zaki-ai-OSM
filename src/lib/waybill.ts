 * yet — which is exactly what any order could become, from the orders list,

 * «لا يُطبع إلا طلب مؤكَّد له شركة شحن» over an order that WAS confirmed and HAD a courier. A parcel that has shipped is the
 * one somebody asks the second copy of: a torn label, the courier's request, the customer's complaint. Only a CANCELLED
 * shipment is still refused (its label would send a parcel nobody wants). And an order that is over never waits for a
 * courier's barcode: there is no scan left to wait for.
 *
 * ── THE OWNER'S KEY ──
 *
 * `anyOrder` is `ops.labels_any`: a waybill for any order, in any state, whatever the rules above say. It is asked by the
 * routes, never here, so nothing but the key can turn it on. Such a print COMMITS NOTHING (`sealsOnPrint`): it is paper, not a
